the art of change_ringing be peculiar to the english , and , like most english peculiarity , unintelligible to the rest of the world .
dorothy l. sayer , `` the nine tailor ``
aslacton , england --
of all scene that evoke rural england , this be one of the lovely : a ancient stone church stand amid the field , the sound of bell cascade from its tower , call the faithful to evensong .
the parishioner of st. michael and all angel stop to chat at the church door , as member here always have .
in the tower , five man and woman pull rhythmically on rope attach to the same five bell that first sound here in 1614 .
but there be also a discordant , modern note in aslacton , though it can not be hear by the churchgoer enjoy the peal of bell this cool autumn evening .
like most of the other 6,000 church in britain with set of bell , st. michael once have its own `` band `` of ringer , who would herald every sunday morning and evening service .
now , only one local ringer remain : 64-year-old derek hammond .
the other here today live elsewhere .
they belong_to a group of 15 ringer -- include two octogenarian and four youngster in training -- who drive every sunday from church to church in a sometimes-exhausting effort to keep the bell sound in the many belfry of east anglium .
`` to ring for even one service at this tower , we have to scrape , `` say mr. hammond , a retired water-authority worker . ``
we have try to train the youngster , but they have they disco and they dance , and they just drift away . ``
mr. hammond worry that old_age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the rank of the east anglian group that keep the aslacton bell peal .
history , after all , be not on he side .
accord to a nationwide survey take a year ago , nearly a third of england 's church bell be no longer ring on sunday because there be no one to ring they .
it be easy to see why the ancient art be on the rope .
the less complicated version of play tune on bell , as do the carillon of continental europe , be consider by the english to be childish , fit only for foreigner .
change_ringing , a mind-boggling exercise the english invent 380 year ago , require physical dexterity -- some bell weigh more than a ton -- combine with intense mental concentration .
proper english bell be start off in `` round , `` from the high-pitched bell to the low -- a simple descend scale use , in large church , as many as 12 bell .
then , at a signal , the ringer begin vary the order in which the bell sound without alter the steady rhythm of the striking .
each variation , or change , can occur only once , the rule state .
ringer memorize pattern of change , know as `` method , `` which have odd-sounding name like kent treble bob major or grandsire cater .
a series of 5,000 or so change be a `` peal `` and take about three hour .
a look at a thursday night practice at st. mary abbot church in the kensington district of london give a idea of the work involve .
ten shirt-sleeved ringer stand in a circle , one foot ahead of the other in a prizefighter 's stance , each pull a rope that disappear through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber .
no one speak , and the snake of the rope seem to make as much sound as the bell themselves , muffle by the ceiling .
totally absorb , the ringer stare straight ahead , use peripheral_vision ( they call it `` rope-sight `` ) to watch the other rope and thus time they pull .
far above in the belfry , the huge bronze bell , mount on wheel , swing madly through a full 360 degree , start and end , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth-up position .
skilled ringer use they wrist to advance or retard the next swing , so that one bell can swap place with another in the following change .
in a well-known detective_story involve church bell , english novelist dorothy l. sayer describe ringing as a `` passion that find its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection . ``
ringer , she add , be `` fill with the solemn intoxication that come of intricate ritual faultlessly perform . `` ``
ringing do become a bit of a obsession , `` admit stephanie pattenden , master of the band at st. mary abbot and one of england 's best female ringer .
it be a passion that usually stay in the tower , however .
more often than not , ringer think_of the church as something stick_on the bottom of the belfry .
when they change be complete , and after they have work_up a sweat , ringer often skip off to the local pub , leave worship for other below .
this do not sit well with some cleric .
with membership of the church_of_england steadily dwindle , strong-willed vicar be press equally strong-willed and often non-religious ringer to attend service .
two year ago , the rev. jeremy hummerstone , vicar of great torrington , devon , get so feed up with ringer who do n't attend service he sack the entire band ; the ringer promptly set_up a picket_line in protest .
`` they be a self-perpetuating club that treat the tower as sort of a separate premises , `` the vicar hummerstone say .
a entirely new band ring today at great torrington , several of whom be member of the congregation .
but there still be not enough ringer to ring more than six of the eight bell .
at st. mary 's church in ilminster , somerset , the bell have fall silent follow a dustup over church attendance .
the vicar , w.d. jone , refuse to talk_about it , say it would `` reopen the wound . ``
but c.j.b. marshall , vicar of a nearby church , feel the fault be in the stairs from the bell_tower that be locate next to the altar .
`` so crunch , crunch , crunch , bang , bang , bang -- here come the ringer from above , make a very obvious exit while the congregation be at prayer , `` he say .
vicar marshall admit to mixed feelings about this issue , since he be both a vicar and a active bell_ringer himself .
`` the sound of bell be a net to draw people into the church , `` he say .
`` I live in hope that the ringer themselves will be draw into that full life . ``
the central council of church bell ringer , a sort of parliament of ringing group , aim to improve relations with vicar , say john c. baldwin , president .
it hope to speak to student at theological college about the joy of bell_ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in the country entitle , `` the bell in you care . ``
say mr baldwin , `` we recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience . ``
mr baldwin be also attack the greater problem : lack of ringer .
one survey say that of the 100,000 train bell_ringer in england today , only 40,000 of they still ring .
also , ringer do not always live where the bell need to be ring -- like in small , rural parish and inner_city church .
but the council 's program to attract and train ringer be only partly successful , say mr baldwin .
`` right now , we be lucky if after five year we keep one new ringer out of 10 , `` he add .
one bright sign be that a grow number of woman have enter the once male-dominated field ; more than a third of the ringer today be woman .
they be not accept everywhere , however .
the oldest bell_ringing group in the country , the ancient society of college youth , found in 1637 , remain male-only , a fact that ' particularly galling to woman because the group be the sole source of ringer for britain 's most prestigious church , st. paul 's cathedral and westminster abbey .
this be britain , no woman have file a equal_opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surface this summer in a series of letter to `` the ringing world , `` a weekly newspaper for ringer .
one writer , sign he letter as `` red-blooded , balanced male , `` remark on the `` frequency of woman faint in peal , `` and suggest that they `` settle back into they traditional role of make tea at meeting . ``
in the torrent of reply that follow , one woman ringer from solihull observe that `` the average male ringer leave quite a lot to be desire : badly dress , decorate with acne and a large beer-belly , frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peal . ``
another woman write from sheffield to say that in she 60 year of ringing , `` I have never know a lady to faint in the belfry .
I have see one or two man die , bless they .
medical scientist be start to uncover a handful of gene which , if damage , unleash the chaotic growth of cell that characterize cancer .
scientist say the discovery of these gene in recent month be paint_a_picture a new and startling picture of how cancer develop .
a emerge understanding of the gene be expect to produce a array of new strategy for future cancer treatment and prevention .
that be for the future .
already , scientist be develop test base on the newly identify gene that , for the first time , can predict whether a otherwise healthy individual be likely to get cancer .
`` it ' a super-exciting set of discovery , `` say bert vogelstein , a john hopkin university researcher who have just find a gene pivotal to the trigger of colon cancer .
`` only a decade ago cancer be a black box about which we know nothing at the molecular level .
today , we know that the accumulation of several of these alter gene can initiate a cancer and , then , propel it into a deadly state . ``
scientist call the new class of gene tumor-suppressor , or simply anticancer gene .
when function normally , they make protein that hold a cell 's growth in check .
but if the gene be damage -- perhaps by radiation , a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division -- they growth-suppressing protein no longer work , and cell normally under control turn malignant .
the newly identify gene differ from a family of gene discover in the early 1980 call oncogene .
oncogene must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researcher have find they in normal as well as in cancerous cell , suggest that oncogene do n't cause cancer by themselves .
in recent month , researcher have come to believe the two type of cancer gene work in_concert : a oncogene may turn proliferate cell malignant only after the tumor-suppressor gene have be damage .
like all gene , tumor-suppressor gene be inherit in two copy , one from each parent .
either copy can make the protein need to control cell growth , so for cancer to arise , both copy must be impaired .
a person who be bear with one defective copy of a suppressor_gene , or in whom one copy be damage early in life , be especially prone to cancer because he need only lose the other copy for a cancer to develop .
emerging genetic test will be able to spot such cancer-susceptible individual , usher_in what some scientist believe be a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis .
bill and bonnie quinlan be among the first beneficiary of the new finding .
the dedham , mas. , couple know even before bonnie become pregnant in 1987 that any child of theirs have a 50 % chance of be at risk for retinoblastoma , a eye cancer that occur about once every 20,000 birth .
mr. quinlan , 30 year old , know he carry a damaged gene , have lose a eye to the rare tumor when he be only two month old -- after he mother have suffer the same fate when she be a baby .
because of the isolation of the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene , it become possible last january to find_out what threat the quinlan baby face .
a test use new `` genetic probe `` show that little will quinlan have not inherit a damaged retinoblastoma suppressor_gene and , therefore , face no more risk than other child of develop the rare cancer .
`` it make we new_year , `` say mr. quinlan .
this test be the first to predict reliably whether a individual could expect to develop cancer .
equally important , the initial discovery of the gene that control retinal cell growth , make by a boston doctor name thaddeus dryja , have open a field of cancer study , which in recent month have explode .
`` it turn_out that study a tragic but uncommon tumor make possible some fundamental insight about the most basic workings of cancer , `` say samuel broder , director of the national cancer institute .
`` all this may not be obvious to the public , which be concerned about advance in treatment , but I be convince this basic research will begin show result there soon . ``
to_date , scientist have finger two of these cancer-suppressor .
dr. dryja make he retinoblastoma discovery in 1986 .
then last spring , researcher report find a gene call p53 which , if impair , turn healthy colon cell cancerous .
soon after that report , two other research team uncover evidence that the same damaged p53 gene be present in tissue from lung and breast cancer .
colon , lung and breast cancer be the most common and lethal form of the disease , collectively kill almost 200,000 american a year .
right now about a dozen laboratory , in the u.s. , canada and britain , be race to unmask other suspected tumor-suppressing gene .
they have about seven candidate .
researcher say the inactivation of tumor-suppressor gene , alone or in combination , appear crucial to the development of such scourge as cancer of the brain , the skin , kidney , prostate , and cervix .
there be evidence that if people inherit defective version of these gene , they be especially prone to cancer , perhaps explain , finally , why some cancer seem to haunt certain family .
the story of tumor-suppressor gene go_back to the 1970s , when a pediatrician name alfred g. knudson jr. propose that retinoblastoma stem from two separate genetic defect .
he theorize that in the eye cancer , a infant inherit a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and a normal copy from the other .
the tumor , he suggest , develop when the second , normal copy also be damage .
but there be no way to prove dr. knudson 's `` two-hit `` theory .
back then , scientist have no way of ferret_out specific gene , but under a microscope they could see the 23 pair of chromosome in the cell that contain the gene .
occasionally , gross chromosome damage be visible .
dr. knudson find that some child with the eye cancer have inherit a damaged copy of chromosome no. 13 from a parent who have have the disease .
under a microscope he could actually see that a bit of chromosome 13 be miss .
he assume the miss piece contain a gene or gene whose loss have a critical role in set_off the cancer .
but he do not know which gene or gene have disappear .
then , a scientific team lead by molecular geneticist webster cavenee , then at the university of utah , find the answer .
the team use a battery of the newly develop `` gene probe , `` snippet of genetic material that can track a gene 's presence in a cell .
by analyze cell extract from eye tumor , they find defect in the second copy of chromosome 13 in the exact area as in the first copy of the chromosome .
the finding rivet medicine .
it be the first time anyone have show that the loss of both copy of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer .
`` it be extraordinarily satisfying , `` say dr. knudson , now at fox chase cancer research center in philadelphium .
`` I be convince that what be true of retinoblastoma would be true for all cancer . ``
it be a audacious claim .
but in baltimore , dr. vogelstein , a young molecular biologist at john hopkin medical school , believe dr. knudson be right , and set_out to repeat the cavenee experiment in cell from other cancer .
he be one of two research team in 1984 to report dual chromosome loss for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney call wilm 's tumor .
dr. vogelstein next turn_to he attention colon cancer , the second big cancer killer in the u.s. after lung cancer .
he believe colon cancer might also arise from multiple `` hit `` on cancer suppressor_gene , because it often seem to develop in stage .
it often be precede by the development of polyp in the bowel , which in some case become increasingly malignant in identifiable stage -- progress from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occur .
dr. vogelstein and a doctoral student , eric fearon , begin month of tedious and often frustrating probe of the chromosome search for sign of genetic damage .
they begin uncover a confusing variety of genetic deletion , some exist only in benign polyp , other in malignant cell and many in both polyp and malignant cell .
gradually , a coherent picture of cancer development emerge .
if both copy of a certain gene be knock_out , benign polyp would develop .
if both copy of a second gene be then delete , the polyp would progress to malignancy .
it be clear that more than one gene have to be damage for colon cancer to develop .
they report galvanize other molecular biologist .
`` it be the confirm evidence we all need that gene loss be critical to the development of a common tumor , `` say ray white at howard hughe medical institute in salt lake city .
but dr. vogelstein have yet to nail the identity of the gene that , if damage , flip a colon cell into full-blown malignancy .
they focus_on chromosome 17 .
for month the john hopkin researcher , use gene probe , experimentally crawl down the length of chromosome 17 , look for the smallest common bit of genetic material lose in all tumor cell .
such a piece of dna would probably constitute a gene .
when they find it last winter , dr. vogelstein be dubious that the search be over .
he doubt stem from the fact that several year earlier a princeton university researcher , arnold levine , have find in experiment with mouse that a gene call p53 could transform normal cell into cancerous one .
the deletion dr. vogelstein find be in exactly the same spot as p53 .
but mr. levine have say the p53 gene cause cancer by promote growth , whereas the john hopkin scientist be look for a gene that suppress growth .
despite that , when the john hopkin scientist compare the gene they have find in the human cancer cell with the mr. levine 's p53 gene they find the two be identical ; it turn_out that in mr. levine 's cancer study , he have unknowingly be observe a damaged form of p53 -- a cancer-suppressing gene .
the discovery `` suddenly put a obscure gene right in the cockpit of cancer formation , `` say robert weinberg , a leader in cancer-gene research at whitehead institute in cambridge , mass .
evidence now be emerge that the p53 suppressor_gene be involve in other cancer , too .
researcher in edinburgh , scotland , have find that in 23 of 38 breast tumor , one copy of chromosome 17 be mutate at the spot where gene p53 lie .
the scientist say that since breast cancer often strike multiple member of certain family , the gene , when inherit in a damaged form , may predispose woman to the cancer .
the p53 gene have just be implicate in lung cancer .
in a report out last week , john minna and colleague at the national cancer institute say that about half the cell take from lung cancer tissue they test be miss this gene .
there also be report from several lab , as yet unpublished , of miss p53 gene in tissue take from kidney , brain and skin cancer .
at_the_same_time , the john hopkin team and other be rush to pinpoint other tumor-suppressor gene .
dr. vogelstein hope soon to isolate one on chromosome 18 , also involve in colon cancer .
ray white in utah and walter bodmer , a researcher in great britain , be close to find another gene involve with some type of colon cancer , think to be on chromosome 5 .
dr. minna believe people who inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of they two copy of chromosome 3 be especially prone to lung cancer .
recently , he and other report that the retinoblastoma suppressor_gene may also be involve in some lung cancer , as well as several other more common cancer , too .
where these discovery will lead , scientist can only speculate .
already two major pharmaceutical company , the squibb unit of bristol-myer squibb co. and hoffmann-la roche inc. , be collaborate with gene hunter to turn the anticipated cascade of discovery into predictive test and , maybe , new therapy .
some researcher say new cancer drug to slow or reverse tumor growth may be base on the suppressor protein normally produce by the gene .
the idea would be to administer to patient the growth-controlling protein make by healthy version of the damaged gene .
it may even be possible to replace defective gene with healthy version , though no one have come_close to do that so far .
in_any_case , say dr. minna of the national cancer institute , `` we be witness the discovery of one of the most important step in the genesis of cancer .
why ca not we teach we child to read , write and reckon ?
it ' not that we do not know how to , because we do .
it ' that we do not want to .
and the reason we do not want to be that effective education would require we to relinquish some cherished metaphysical belief about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in_particular , well as to violate some cherished vested interest .
these belief so dominate we educational establishment , we media , we politician , and even we parent that it seem almost blasphemous to challenge they .
here be a example .
if I be to ask a sample of american parent , `` do you wish the elementary_school to encourage creativity in you child ? `` the near-unanimous answer would be , `` yes , of_course . ``
but what do we mean , specifically , by `` creativity `` ?
no one can say .
in_practice , it end_up be equate with a `` self-expression `` that encourage the youngster ' `` self-esteem . ``
the result be a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual incompetence be match only by they good opinion of themselves .
the whole notion of `` creativity `` in education be ( and be ) part and parcel of a romantic rebellion against disciplined instruction , which be ( and be ) regard_as `` authoritarian , `` a repression and frustration of the latent talent and the wonderful , if as yet undefined , potentiality inherent in the soul of all we child .
it be not surprising that parent find this romantic extravagance so attractive .
fortunately , these same parent do want they child to get a decent education as traditionally understand , and they have enough common_sense to know what that demand .
they commitment to `` creativity `` can not survive adolescent illiteracy .
american education 's future will be determine by the degree to which we -- all of we -- allow this common_sense to prevail over the illusion that we also share .
the education establishment will fight against common_sense every_inch of the way .
the reason be complex , but one simple reason ought not to be underestimate .
`` progressive education `` ( as it be once call ) be far more interesting and agreeable to teacher than be disciplined instruction .
it be nice for teacher to think they be engage in `` personality development `` and even nice to minimize those irksome test with often disappointing result .
it also provide teacher with a superior self-definition as a `` profession , `` since they will have pass course in educational psychology and educational philosophy .
I myself take such course in college , think I might end_up a schoolteacher .
they could all fairly be describe as `` pap `` course .
but it be unfair to dump on teacher , as distinct from the educational establishment .
I know many schoolteacher and , on_the_whole , they be seriously commit to conscientious teaching .
they may not be among the `` best and bright `` of they generation -- there be very few such people , by definition .
but they need not be to do they job well .
yes , we all can remember one or two truly inspiring teacher from we school day .
but we education proceed at the hand of those other , who be merely competent and conscientious .
in this sense , a teacher can be compare to one 's family_doctor .
if he be brilliant , he probably would not be a family_doctor in_the_first_place .
if he be competent and conscientious , he serve we well .
we teacher be not a important factor in we educational crisis .
whether they be or be not underpaid be a problem of equity ; it be not a educational problem .
it be silly libel on we teacher to think they would educate we child better if only they get a few thousand dollar a year more .
it be the kind of libel the teacher ' union do not mind spread , for they own narrow purpose .
it be also the kind of libel politician find useful , since it help they strike a friendly posture on behalf of a important constituency .
but there be not one shred of evidence that , other thing be equal , salary differential result in educational differential .
if there be such evidence , you can be sure you would have hear of it .
if we wish to be serious about american education , we know exactly what to do -- and , just as important , what not to do .
there be many successful school scattered throughout this nation , some of they in the poor of ghetto , and they be all send we the same message .
conversely , there be the majority of unsuccessful school , and we know which effort at educational reform be doom beforehand .
we really do know all we need to know , if only we could assimilate this knowledge into we thinking .
in this respect , it would be helpful if we political leader be mute , rather than eloquently `` concern . ``
they be inevitably inclined to echo the conventional pap , since this be the least controversial option that be open to they .
thus at the recent governor ' conference on education , gov. bill clinton of arkansa announce that `` this country need a comprehensive child-development policy for child under five . ``
a comprehensive development policy for governor over 30 would seem to be a more pressing need .
what gov. clinton be advocate , in_effect , be extend the educational system down to the pre-kindergarten year .
whether desirable or not , this be a childcare program , not a educational program .
we know that very early exposure to schooling improve performance in the first grade , but afterward the difference be quickly wash away .
let we sum_up what we do know about education and about those education reform that do work and do not work : -- `` parental involvement `` be a bad idea .
parent be too likely to blame school for the educational limitation of they child .
parent should be involved with they child 's education at home , not in school .
they should see to it that they kid do not play truant ; they should make certain that the child spend enough time do homework ; they should scrutinize the report_card .
if parent be dissatisfy with a school , they should have the option of switch to another .
-- `` community involvement `` be a even worse idea .
here , the experience of new york city be decisive .
locally elected school_board , especially in we larger city , become the prey of ambitious , generally corrupt , and invariably demagogic local politician or would-be politician .
new york be in the process of try to disengage itself from a 20-year-old commitment to this system of school governance , even as chicago and other city be move to institute it .
-- in most state , increased expenditure on education , in we current circumstance , will probably make thing worse , not better .
the reason be simple : education take_place in the classroom , where the influence of money be minimal .
decade of educational research tell we unequivocally that even smaller class have zero effect on the academic performance of the pupil -- though they may sometimes be desirable for other reason .
the new money flow into the already top-heavy administrative structure , which busy itself pile more and more paperwork on the teacher .
there be neither mystery nor paradox in the fact that as educational expenditure ( in real term ) have increase sharply in the past quarter-of-a-century -- we now spend more per pupil than any other country in the world -- educational performance have decline .
that be the way the system work .
-- student should move up the educational ladder as they academic potential allow .
no student should be permit to be graduate from elementary_school without have master the 3 r ' at the level that prevail 20 year ago .
this mean `` tracking , `` whose main purpose be less to permit the gifted youngster to flourish ( though that be clearly desirable ) than to ensure that the less gifted get the necessary grounding for further study or for enter the modern world of work .
the notion that tracking be somehow `` undemocratic `` be absurd .
the purpose of education be to encourage young man and woman to realize they full academic potential .
no one in he right mind actually believe that we all have a equal academic potential .
-- it be generally desirable to use older textbook -- many of they , alas , out of print -- rather than new one .
the latter be modish , trendy , often downright silly , and at best insubstantial .
they be base on dubious psychological and sociological theory rather than on educational experience .
one of the reason american student do so poorly in math test , as compare with british , french , german or japanese student , be the influence of the `` new math `` on american textbook and teaching method .
anyone who want to appreciate just how bizarre this situation be -- with student who ca not add or subtract `` learn `` the conceptual basis of mathematical theory -- should read the article by caleb nelson ( himself a recent math major at harvard ) in the november american spectator .
-- most important of all , school should have principal with a large measure of authority over the faculty , the curriculum , and all matter of student discipline .
study after study -- the most recent from the brooking institution -- tell we that the best school be those that be free of outside interference and be govern by a powerful head .
with that authority , of_course , go_with a unambiguous accountability .
school that be structured in this way produce student with higher morale and superior academic performance .
this be a fact -- though , in view of all the feather that be ruffle by this fact , it be not surprising that one hear so little about it .
mr. kristol , a american enterprise institute fellow , co-edit the public interest and publish the national interest .
